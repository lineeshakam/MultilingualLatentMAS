# Benchmark-suite instance driver: runs each given config sequentially with
# resume, retrying up to MAX_ATTEMPTS per config. benchmark_runner.py's Stage-E
# now checkpoints per (benchmark, language) chunk within a mode (not just on
# full-mode completion), so a kill mid-mode only re-does the in-flight chunk
# instead of the whole mode -- retries are genuinely cheap now, hence the
# higher attempt budget below. The python call itself is nohup'd so it
# survives a SIGHUP if this driver's controlling terminal ever goes away
# (it is already double-forked to init by the caller, but belt-and-suspenders).
# One instance owns the GPUs in $2 via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES; configs address
# them as cuda:0/1/2.
#
# Usage: run_instance.sh <instance_name> <gpu_ids> <config1.yaml> [config2.yaml ...]

# Prevents a class of bug hit 2026-07-08: a __pycache__ .pyc compiled before
# a source edit can be treated as still-valid if the .py mtime ever moves
# backward (e.g. a git checkout/reset after the edit), silently running old
# bytecode in a fresh process despite the source file on disk being current.
# Cost is a full recompile per launch, negligible next to these jobs' runtime.
