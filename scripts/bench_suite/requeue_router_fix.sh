# Router-fix requeue watcher (see [[router-safety-fixes-predate-jul5-runs]]).
#
# The het/hom bench_suite instances launched 2026-07-05T15:50 hold their GPUs
# for the lifetime of the *already-running* python process, which loaded the
# pre-fix AttentionRouter (uniform routing, confidence pinned ~0.335-0.341)
# into memory before commit 3f75cfb seeded real routing keys -- a running
# process never picks up a code fix, only a fresh `python` invocation does.
# run_instance.sh's own retry-on-crash loop already re-execs python (so a
# crash mid-mode self-heals onto the fixed code for free); the only case that
# needs help is the instance finishing *cleanly* under the old code, which
# writes token_based_mas/latent_based_mas_ours result caches stamped with the
# stale router regime that `--resume` would otherwise silently keep reusing
# forever (checkpointing only checks key presence, not code_regime).
#
# This script waits for the whole driver (both configs, e.g.
# het_belebele_sg.yaml then het_mgsm.yaml) to vacate its GPUs, then for each
# config: invalidates any mode cache not stamped code_regime.router ==
# "prototype-seeded", and if anything was invalidated (or never finished),
# reruns just those two modes with --comm-modes so single_agent_baseline
# (already valid, router-independent) is skipped via the existing cache.
#
# Usage (daemonize like run_instance.sh / rerun_baselines_queue.sh):
#   setsid nohup bash scripts/bench_suite/requeue_router_fix.sh \
#     <instance_name> <gpu_ids> <driver_pid> <config1.yaml> [config2.yaml ...] \
#     >> logs/bench_suite/<instance_name>.router_fix_watcher.log 2>&1 &
#
# Idempotent: safe to launch more than once or after a restart -- configs
# whose caches are already fully prototype-seeded are skipped, and a
# mid-flight invocation of this script's own rerun is resumable via
# --resume.
set -u
# Prevents a class of bug hit 2026-07-08: a __pycache__ .pyc compiled before
# a source edit can be treated as still-valid if the .py mtime ever moves
# backward (e.g. a git checkout/reset after the edit), silently running old
# bytecode in a fresh process despite the source file on disk being current.
# Cost is a full recompile per launch, negligible next to these jobs' runtime.
