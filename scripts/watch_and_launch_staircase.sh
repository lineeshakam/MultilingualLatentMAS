# Polls nvidia-smi until >=4 GPUs are simultaneously idle (<500MiB used), then
# launches the staircase ablation (scripts/run_ablation_staircase.py) pinned
# to those 4 GPUs via CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES. This is "multiple GPU-days" per
# the runner's own docstring, so it only starts once real capacity exists
# rather than contending with the in-flight het/hom bench_suite runs.
#
# If results/mechanistic/geo_profiles.json doesn't exist yet (prerequisite
# for rows 3-6, produced by the GPU7 chain watcher), runs only rows 0-2 for
# now; the caller should relaunch this script for the remaining rows once
# that artifact lands (idempotent: run_ablation_staircase.py isolates each
# row's own output dir, so partial completion is safe to resume/extend).
#
# GPU claims are serialized via flock across ALL gpu-watching scripts
# (staircase, oneflow, ...): the entire detect-and-launch decision happens
# inside one held lock per attempt, not just the nvidia-smi read, so two
# watchers can never both see the same idle GPU and double-book it.

# backward (e.g. a git checkout/reset after the edit), silently running old
# bytecode in a fresh process despite the source file on disk being current.
# Cost is a full recompile per launch, negligible next to these jobs' runtime.
